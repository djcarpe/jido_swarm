> **Jido is an autonomous agent framework for Elixir, built for workflows and multi-agent systems.**
<!-- package.jido.framework -->

Define agents, connect them to actions, signals, and directives, and run them
with supervision and fault tolerance built in.

_The name "Jido" (自動) comes from the Japanese word meaning "automatic" or "automated", where 自 (ji) means "self" and 動 (dō) means "movement"._

_Learn more about Jido at [jido.run](https://jido.run)._

## Overview

Jido helps you build agent systems as ordinary Elixir and OTP software.

- Agents hold state and implement `cmd/2`
- Actions do work and transform that state
- Signals route events into the system
- Directives describe effects for the runtime to execute

The purity boundary is the agent's decision logic: Jido keeps agent decisions and
state transitions explicit, actions may be pure or effectful, and directives are
for effects you want the runtime to own.

Use Jido when software needs to inspect context, choose among multiple steps,
coordinate with other agents, and keep running reliably over time.

AI is optional. The core package gives you the agent architecture and runtime;
companion packages such as `jido_ai` add model integration when you need it.

At the core, Jido agents are immutable data structures with a single command function:

```elixir
defmodule MyAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "my_agent",
    description: "My custom agent",
    schema: [
      count: [type: :integer, default: 0]
    ]
end

{agent, directives} = MyAgent.cmd(agent, action)
```

State changes are explicit data transformations. If an action needs a result
back immediately to continue reasoning or update state, it may perform that work
itself. If the workflow has already decided on an outbound effect and wants the
runtime or integration layer to own delivery, return a directive.

## Why Jido?

OTP primitives are excellent. You can build agent systems with raw GenServer. But when building *multiple cooperating agents*, you'll reinvent:

| Raw OTP                             | Jido Formalizes                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Ad-hoc message shapes per GenServer | Signals as standard envelope            |
| Business logic mixed in callbacks   | Actions as reusable command pattern     |
| Implicit effects scattered in code  | Directives as typed effect descriptions |
| Custom child tracking per server    | Built-in parent/child hierarchy         |
| Process exit = completion           | State-based completion semantics        |

Jido isn't "better GenServer" - it's a formalized agent pattern built *on* GenServer.

## Key Features

### Immutable Agent Architecture
- Functional agent state model inspired by Elm/Redux
- `cmd/2` as the core operation: actions in, updated agent + directives out
- Schema-validated state with NimbleOptions or Zoi

### Directive-Based Effects
- Actions transform state and may perform required work
- Directives describe runtime-owned external effects
- Built-in directives: Emit, Spawn, SpawnAgent, StopChild, StartSensor, StopSensor, Schedule, Stop
- Protocol-based extensibility for custom directives

### OTP Runtime Integration
- GenServer-based AgentServer for production deployment
- Parent-child agent hierarchies with lifecycle management
- Signal routing with configurable strategies
- Instance-scoped supervision plus logical partitions for multi-tenant deployments

### Composable Plugins
- Reusable capability modules that extend agents
- State isolation per plugin with automatic schema merging
- Lifecycle hooks for initialization and signal handling

### Execution Strategies
- Direct execution for simple workflows
- FSM (Finite State Machine) strategy for state-driven workflows
- Extensible strategy protocol for custom execution patterns

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Multi-agent workflows with configurable strategies
- Plan-based orchestration for complex workflows
- Durable groups of agents with named topology, hierarchical runtime ownership, nested pod nodes, and partition-safe tenancy boundaries

### Shared Context & Knowledge Graphs
- An embedded property graph per agent, backed by [Glider](https://github.com/agentjido/glider) — reads are a function call, not a network hop
- Topic-routed replication, so what one agent learns reaches the agents that asked for it
- In memory, on disk, or snapshotted to S3 — and streamed across machines through an S3 topic log
- Last-writer-wins convergence with tombstones; no leader, no shared database
- See `mix jido.context.mesh` for three agents sharing one mesh

## Installation

### Using Igniter (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is with [Igniter](https://hex.pm/packages/igniter):

```bash
mix igniter.install jido
```

This automatically:
- Adds Jido to your dependencies
- Creates a `MyApp.Jido` instance module (`use Jido, otp_app: :my_app`)
- Creates configuration in `config/config.exs`
- Adds `MyApp.Jido` to your supervision tree

Generate an example agent to get started:

```bash
mix igniter.install jido --example
```

### Manual Installation

Add `jido` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jido, "~> 2.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then define a Jido instance module and add it to your supervision tree:

```elixir
# In lib/my_app/jido.ex
defmodule MyApp.Jido do
  use Jido, otp_app: :my_app
end
```

```elixir
# In config/config.exs
config :my_app, MyApp.Jido,
  max_tasks: 1000,
  agent_pools: []
```

```elixir
# In your application.ex
children = [
  MyApp.Jido
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Define an Agent

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CounterAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "counter",
    description: "A simple counter agent",
    schema: [
      count: [type: :integer, default: 0]
    ],
    signal_routes: [
      {"increment", MyApp.Actions.Increment}
    ]
end
```

### 2. Define an Action

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Actions.Increment do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "increment",
    description: "Increments the counter by a given amount",
    schema: [
      amount: [type: :integer, default: 1]
    ]

  def run(params, context) do
    current = context.state[:count] || 0
    {:ok, %{count: current + params.amount}}
  end
end
```

### 3. Execute Commands

```elixir
# Create an agent
agent = MyApp.CounterAgent.new()

# Execute an action - returns updated agent + directives
{agent, directives} = MyApp.CounterAgent.cmd(agent, {MyApp.Actions.Increment, %{amount: 5}})

# Check the state
agent.state.count
# => 5
```

### 4. Run with AgentServer

```elixir
# Start the agent server
{:ok, pid} = MyApp.Jido.start_agent(MyApp.CounterAgent, id: "counter-1")

# Send signals to the running agent (synchronous)
# Signal types must be declared in signal_routes
{:ok, agent} = Jido.AgentServer.call(pid, Jido.Signal.new!("increment", %{amount: 10}, source: "/user"))

# Look up the agent by ID
pid = MyApp.Jido.whereis("counter-1")

# List all running agents
agents = MyApp.Jido.list_agents()
```

## Core Concepts

### The `cmd/2` Contract

The fundamental operation in Jido:

```elixir
{agent, directives} = MyAgent.cmd(agent, action)
```

Key invariants:
- The returned `agent` is always complete - no "apply directives" step needed
- `directives` describe runtime-owned external effects only - they never modify
  agent state
- Agent decision logic stays explicit and testable; deterministic actions produce
  deterministic `cmd/2` results

Use this rule of thumb for side effects:

- If the step needs a result back now to continue reasoning or update state, an
  effectful action is acceptable.
- If the workflow has already decided on an outbound effect and wants the
  runtime or integration layer to own delivery, return a directive.

### Actions vs Directives vs State Operations

| Actions                                    | Directives                            | State Operations                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Transform state, may perform side effects  | Describe runtime-owned effects        | Describe internal state changes |
| Executed by `cmd/2`, update `agent.state`  | Bare structs emitted by agents        | Applied by strategy layer       |
| Can call APIs, read files, query databases | Runtime (AgentServer) interprets them | Never leave the strategy        |

### State Operations (`Jido.Agent.StateOp`)

State operations are internal state transitions handled by the strategy layer during `cmd/2`. Unlike directives, they never reach the runtime.

| StateOp        | Purpose                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `SetState`     | Deep merge attributes into state |
| `ReplaceState` | Replace state wholesale          |
| `DeleteKeys`   | Remove top-level keys            |
| `SetPath`      | Set value at nested path         |
| `DeletePath`   | Delete value at nested path      |

### Directive Types

| Directive    | Purpose                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Emit`       | Dispatch a signal via configured adapters        |
| `Error`      | Signal an error from cmd/2                       |
| `Spawn`      | Spawn a generic BEAM child process               |
| `SpawnAgent` | Spawn a tracked child Jido agent (`restart: :transient` by default) |
| `StopChild`  | Gracefully stop and remove a tracked child agent                      |
| `StartSensor` | Start or replace a tagged sensor runtime        |
| `StopSensor` | Stop a tagged sensor runtime                     |
| `Schedule`   | Schedule a delayed message                       |
| `Stop`       | Stop the agent process                           |

Sensor runtimes started by `StartSensor` are tracked under `{:sensor, tag}` and
are owner-monitored by default. Unexpected sensor exits emit
`jido.agent.sensor.exit` back to the owning agent; controlled `StopSensor`
shutdowns do not. Use `link?: true` only when a sensor should fail fast with
its owning `AgentServer`.

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is Jido and how does it differ from other agent frameworks?**

A: Jido is an **autonomous agent framework for Elixir, built for workflows and multi-agent systems**. Key differentiators:
- **OTP-native architecture**: Built on GenServer with supervision and fault tolerance built in
- **Immutable agents**: Functional state model inspired by Elm/Redux
- **AI optional**: Core package provides agent architecture without requiring AI/LLM
- **Explicit effect boundaries**: actions may own immediate work; directives describe runtime-owned effects

Compared to LangChain/CrewAI:
- **LangChain**: Chain-based orchestration, Python-first
- **CrewAI**: Role-playing autonomous agents, team-based collaboration
- **Jido**: OTP-native with supervision trees, Elixir/BEAM ecosystem

**Q: What is the Agent/Action/Signal/Directive architecture?**

A:
- **Agents**: Immutable structs plus modules that hold state and implement `cmd/2`
- **Actions**: Receive validated params and context, then return state updates and optional directives
- **Signals**: CloudEvents-compliant messages routed into the system
- **Directives**: Bare structs that describe effects for the runtime to execute

`cmd/2` returns the updated agent plus directives. Directives never mutate agent
state; the OTP runtime interprets them for runtime-owned external effects.
Actions may still perform work such as API calls, file I/O, or database queries
when that result is needed immediately by the action or state transition.

**Q: Is AI required for Jido?**

A: **No!** The core package (`jido`) provides agent architecture and runtime without AI. AI/LLM integration is optional via companion packages:
- `jido_ai`: AI/LLM integration for agents
- `req_llm`: HTTP client for LLM APIs

Use Jido when software needs to inspect context, choose steps, coordinate agents, and run reliably - AI is optional.

**Q: What are the Jido ecosystem packages?**

A:
| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **req_llm** | HTTP client for LLM APIs |
| **jido_action** | Composable, validated actions with AI tool integration |
| **jido_signal** | CloudEvents-based message envelope and routing utilities |
| **jido** | Core agent framework with state management, directives, runtime |
| **jido_ai** | AI/LLM integration for agents |

### Getting Started

- Easy capability sharing across agents

See [Plugins Guide](guides/plugins.md) for details.

**Q: What execution strategies are available?**

A:
- **Direct Strategy**: Immediate execution
- **FSM Strategy**: State machine workflows

See [Strategies Guide](guides/strategies.md) and [FSM Strategy Deep Dive](guides/fsm-strategy.livemd).

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I'm getting GenServer timeout errors. What should I check?**

A:
1. Check action execution time
2. Consider using worker pools for throughput (`guides/worker-pools.md`)
3. Review supervision tree configuration
