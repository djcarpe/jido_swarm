Plugins are composable capability modules that extend an agent's functionality. They encapsulate actions, state, configuration, and signal routing into reusable units.

## When to Use Plugins

Use plugins when you want to:
- Package related actions together with their state
- Reuse capabilities across multiple agents
- Isolate state for a specific domain (e.g., chat, database, metrics)
- Define signal routing rules for a group of actions

## Defining a Plugin

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ChatPlugin do
  use Jido.Plugin,
    name: "chat",
    state_key: :chat,
    actions: [MyApp.Actions.SendMessage, MyApp.Actions.ListHistory],
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      messages: Zoi.list(Zoi.any()) |> Zoi.default([]),
      model: Zoi.string() |> Zoi.default("gpt-4")
    }),
    signal_routes: [
      {"send", MyApp.Actions.SendMessage},
      {"history", MyApp.Actions.ListHistory}
    ]
end
```

### Required Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `name` | Plugin name (letters, numbers, underscores only) |
| `state_key` | Atom key for plugin state in agent's state map |
| `actions` | List of action modules the plugin provides |

### Optional Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `schema` | Zoi schema for plugin state defaults |
| `config_schema` | Zoi schema for per-agent configuration |
| `signal_patterns` | Patterns that select which signals run plugin signal hooks |
| `signal_routes` | Static routes relative to the plugin's route prefix |
| `category`, `vsn`, `tags` | Metadata for organization |

## Using Plugins

Attach plugins to agents via the `plugins:` option:

```elixir
defmodule MyAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "my_agent",
    plugins: [
      MyApp.ChatPlugin,
      {MyApp.DatabasePlugin, %{pool_size: 5}}  # With config
    ]
end
```

Plugins are mounted during `new/1`. Each plugin's state is initialized under its `state_key`.

## State Isolation

Plugin state is nested under the plugin's `state_key`:

```elixir
# ChatPlugin with state_key: :chat
agent.state = %{
  chat: %{messages: [], model: "gpt-4"},  # ChatPlugin state
  database: %{pool_size: 5}               # DatabasePlugin state
}

# Access plugin state
chat_state = MyAgent.plugin_state(agent, :chat)
```

This prevents plugins from interfering with each other's state.

## Lifecycle Callbacks

All callbacks are optional with sensible defaults.

### Signal phases

AgentServer owns a fixed signal lifecycle. Plugins are the extension mechanism
for phase-specific behavior; AgentServer does not expose a generic middleware
chain.

```text
incoming signal
-> handle_signal/2
-> prepare_signal/2
-> route
-> prepare_action/3
-> Agent.cmd/3
-> directives queued
-> prepare_emit/2
-> dispatch
-> transform_result/3 on synchronous call return only
```

Plugins run in declaration order. `handle_signal/2`, `prepare_signal/2`, and
`prepare_action/3` are gated by `signal_patterns`. `prepare_emit/2` runs for
all plugins so outbound signing/encryption plugins can decide by pattern
matching the emitted signal.

`handle_signal/2` remains in the lifecycle for backwards compatibility and for
coarse signal control. New identity, encryption, and authorization extensions
should prefer the narrower preparation hooks: use `prepare_signal/2` to verify,
decrypt, canonicalize, and attach runtime context, then use `prepare_action/3`
to authorize the resolved action.

### mount/2

Called during `new/1` to initialize plugin state. Pure function—no side effects.

```elixir
@impl Jido.Plugin
def mount(agent, config) do
  {:ok, %{initialized_at: DateTime.utc_now(), api_key: config[:api_key]}}
end
```

Returns `{:ok, map}` to merge into plugin state, or `{:error, reason}` to abort agent creation.

### signal_routes (compile-time)

Define signal-to-action routing rules declaratively in `use Jido.Plugin`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ChatPlugin do
  use Jido.Plugin,
    name: "chat",
    state_key: :chat,
    actions: [MyApp.Actions.SendMessage, MyApp.Actions.ListHistory],
    signal_routes: [
      {"send", MyApp.Actions.SendMessage},
      {"history", MyApp.Actions.ListHistory}
    ]
end
```

Static plugin routes are relative to the plugin's route prefix. For this
plugin, Jido expands `"send"` to `"chat.send"`.

Use the `signal_routes/1` callback only when routes must be computed from runtime config.

### handle_signal/2

Pre-routing compatibility hook called before signal routing. Use this for coarse
rejection, legacy signal rewrites, or route override. Do not use it as the
primary identity or encryption hook; it does not return runtime context and its
route override power makes it intentionally broader than security preparation.

```elixir
@impl Jido.Plugin
def handle_signal(signal, context) do
  cond do
    signal.type == "admin.override" ->
      {:ok, {:override, MyApp.AdminAction}}
    blocked?(signal) ->
      {:error, :blocked}
    true ->
      {:ok, :continue}
  end
end
```

The `context` map contains `:agent`, `:agent_module`, `:plugin`, `:plugin_spec`, and `:config`.

### prepare_signal/2

Runs after `handle_signal/2` and before routing. Use it to verify, decrypt, or
canonicalize the effective signal and to attach runtime context for later phases.
This is the preferred inbound hook for identity and encrypted communication
extensions because it has a narrow contract: return the prepared signal plus a
runtime context delta, or fail closed.

```elixir
@impl Jido.Plugin
def prepare_signal(signal, context) do
  identity = verify_signature!(signal)
  {:ok, signal, %{identity: identity}}
end
```

The returned runtime context delta is merged into accumulated `:runtime_context`.
Reserved runtime keys are rejected: `:state`, `:signal`, `:agent`,
`:agent_server_pid`, `:input_signal`, `:directive`, and `:dispatch`.
Duplicate top-level runtime context keys are also rejected.

### prepare_action/3

Runs after routing and before agent command execution. Use it to authorize the
resolved action against the prepared signal and accumulated runtime context.

```elixir
@impl Jido.Plugin
def prepare_action(_signal, {MyApp.AdminAction, _params}, context) do
  if "admin" in context.runtime_context.identity.scopes do
    {:ok, %{authorized?: true}}
  else
    {:error, :unauthorized}
  end
end
```

This hook cannot rewrite the signal or action. It returns additional runtime
context or fails closed.

### prepare_emit/2

Runs before an emitted signal is dispatched. Use it to sign, encrypt, enrich, or
reroute outbound signals. Its context includes `:input_signal`,
`:runtime_context`, `:directive`, `:dispatch`, plugin metadata, agent metadata,
`:jido_instance`, and `:partition`.

```elixir
@impl Jido.Plugin
def prepare_emit(signal, context) do
  encrypted = encrypt_for_dispatch(signal, context.dispatch)
  {:ok, encrypted}
end
```

Return `{:ok, signal}` to keep the current dispatch or `{:ok, signal, dispatch}`
to rewrite dispatch.

### transform_result/3

Transforms the agent returned from `AgentServer.call/3` (synchronous path only).
This is a caller-view hook, not a security hook; failures are logged and the
agent is returned unchanged.

```elixir
@impl Jido.Plugin
def transform_result(_action, agent, _context) do
  new_state = Map.put(agent.state, :last_call_at, DateTime.utc_now())
  %{agent | state: new_state}
end
```

### child_spec/1

Returns child process specifications started during `AgentServer.init/1`.

```elixir
@impl Jido.Plugin
def child_spec(config) do
  %{id: MyWorker, start: {MyWorker, :start_link, [config]}}
end
```

Return `nil` for no children, a single spec, or a list of specs.

## Composing Multiple Plugins

Agents can use multiple plugins with isolated state:

```elixir
defmodule MyAssistant do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "assistant",
    plugins: [
      MyApp.ChatPlugin,
      MyApp.MemoryPlugin,
      {MyApp.ToolsPlugin, %{enabled_tools: [:search, :calculator]}}
    ]
end
```

Each plugin maintains its own state slice and routing rules. Plugins are mounted in order, so later plugins can depend on state from earlier ones.

## Default Plugins

Jido ships with **default plugins** that are automatically included in every agent. These are framework-provided singleton plugins that handle core concerns.

### Built-in Defaults

| Plugin | State Key | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `Jido.Agent.Identity.Plugin` | `:__identity__` | Agent identity: profile, lifecycle facts |
| `Jido.Thread.Plugin` | `:__thread__` | Conversation thread management |
| `Jido.Memory.Plugin` | `:__memory__` | On-demand memory container for agent cognitive state |

Default plugins are **singletons** — only one instance per state key. They are mounted during `new/1` like any other plugin, but they don't initialize state by default. State is created on demand using helpers like `Jido.Agent.Identity.Agent.ensure/2` and `Jido.Memory.Agent.ensure/2`.

`Jido.Pod` also uses this mechanism for pod-wrapped agents: it injects a
singleton plugin under the reserved `:__pod__` key. That plugin is not a
framework-wide default for all agents, but pod agents can still replace it via
the normal `default_plugins: %{__pod__: ...}` override path.

### Identity Plugin

The identity plugin gives every agent a first-class profile/lifecycle state
primitive stored at `agent.state[:__identity__]`. The state key remains the
canonical identity storage key; the struct and helper modules now live under
`Jido.Agent.Identity` so `Jido.Identity` can be used by top-level identity
extensions, including the separate `jido_identity` package.

The default plugin keeps the existing `identity` metadata name and `:identity`
capability because plugin ownership remains anchored on `:__identity__`.

#### Naming and Migration

The rename separates two concepts that previously shared the same namespace:

| Concept | API owner |
|---------|-----------|
| Agent identity state: profile, age, origin, generation, revision | `Jido.Agent.Identity` |
| Top-level identity extensions: keys, principals, signatures, attestations | `Jido.Identity` in a separate identity package |

For built-in identity helpers, update these names:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `Jido.Identity` | `Jido.Agent.Identity` |
| `Jido.Identity.Agent` | `Jido.Agent.Identity.Agent` |
| `Jido.Identity.Profile` | `Jido.Agent.Identity.Profile` |
| `Jido.Identity.Actions.Evolve` | `Jido.Agent.Identity.Actions.Evolve` |
| `Jido.Identity.Agent.has_identity?/1` | `Jido.Agent.Identity.Agent.has_identity?/1` |

These surfaces intentionally do not change:

- Agent state still stores the identity at `agent.state[:__identity__]`.
- Default plugin overrides still use `default_plugins: %{__identity__: ...}`.
- The default plugin metadata name remains `identity`.
- The default plugin capability remains `:identity`.
- The evolve action metadata name remains `identity_evolve`.

```elixir
alias Jido.Agent.Identity.Agent, as: IdentityAgent
alias Jido.Agent.Identity.Profile

agent = MyAgent.new()

# Identity state is not initialized until you ask for it
refute IdentityAgent.has_identity?(agent)

# Initialize on demand
agent = IdentityAgent.ensure(agent, profile: %{age: 0, origin: :spawned})

# Read profile data
Profile.age(agent)    #=> 0
Profile.get(agent, :origin)  #=> :spawned

# Evolve identity profile facts over simulated time
{agent, []} = MyAgent.cmd(agent, {Jido.Agent.Identity.Actions.Evolve, %{years: 3}})
Profile.age(agent)    #=> 3
```

To fully replace the default identity with your own implementation, define a custom plugin that uses the same state key:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CustomIdentityPlugin do
  use Jido.Plugin,
    name: "custom_identity",
    state_key: :__identity__,
    actions: [],
    description: "Custom identity with auto-initialization."

  @impl Jido.Plugin
  def mount(_agent, config) do
    profile = Map.get(config, :profile, %{age: 0})
    {:ok, Jido.Agent.Identity.new(profile: profile)}
  end
end

defmodule MyAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "my_agent",
    default_plugins: %{
      __identity__: {MyApp.CustomIdentityPlugin, %{profile: %{age: 5, origin: :configured}}}
    }
end
```

Persisted checkpoints from earlier Jido releases may still contain a
`%Jido.Identity{}` struct at `:__identity__`. `Jido.Persist.thaw/3` migrates
that value to `%Jido.Agent.Identity{}` automatically during restore. For
custom storage or manual checkpoint handling, use
`Jido.Agent.Identity.migrate_legacy/1`,
`Jido.Agent.Identity.migrate_state/1`, or
`Jido.Agent.Identity.migrate_checkpoint/1`.

The migration only converts the exact old core agent identity struct shape
(`rev`, `profile`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`). Other values under
`:__identity__`, including custom plugin state or top-level `Jido.Identity`
extension structs, are left unchanged. Jido does not provide deprecated
`Jido.Identity` shim modules because keeping those modules would continue to
claim the top-level namespace this rename frees.

### Thread Plugin

The Thread plugin stores `agent.state[:__thread__]` as an append-only journal of
what happened. Thread entries should be treated as immutable facts.

If external metadata arrives later, append a follow-up entry that points back
to the original entry instead of updating it in place. The caller supplies a
stable `entry_id` up front so later events can reference it:

```elixir
alias Jido.Thread.Agent, as: ThreadAgent

entry_id = "entry_" <> Jido.Util.generate_id()

agent =
  ThreadAgent.append(agent, %{
    id: entry_id,
    kind: :message,
    payload: %{role: "assistant", content: "hello"}
  })

agent =
  ThreadAgent.append(agent, %{
    kind: :message_committed,
    payload: %{provider: :slack, remote_id: slack_ts},
    refs: %{entry_id: entry_id}
  })
```

This is the preferred way to model late provider acknowledgements, delivery
receipts, and similar metadata while preserving thread history. For the
rationale and a more general pattern, see
[Persistence & Storage](storage.md#modeling-late-metadata-with-follow-up-events).

### Memory Plugin

The Memory plugin gives every agent an on-demand cognitive memory container stored at `agent.state[:__memory__]`. Memory is organized into **spaces** — named containers holding either map (key-value) or list (ordered items) data. Two reserved spaces, `:world` and `:tasks`, are created by default. Domain-specific wrappers should be built in your own modules on top of the generic space primitives.

The built-in plugin is deliberately minimal. Packages that provide their own
memory implementation should use the same `:__memory__` state key and replace
the default through `default_plugins:`, not by mounting a second memory plugin
in `plugins:`.

```elixir
alias Jido.Memory.Agent, as: MemoryAgent

agent = MyAgent.new()

# Memory is not initialized until you ask for it
refute MemoryAgent.has_memory?(agent)

# Initialize on demand
agent = MemoryAgent.ensure(agent)

# Work with map spaces (e.g. :world)
agent = MemoryAgent.put_in_space(agent, :world, :temperature, 22)
MemoryAgent.get_in_space(agent, :world, :temperature)  #=> 22

# Work with list spaces (e.g. :tasks)
agent = MemoryAgent.append_to_space(agent, :tasks, %{id: "t1", text: "Check sensor"})
```

### Overriding and Disabling Defaults

Default plugins can be controlled per-agent using the `default_plugins:` option with a map keyed by state key:

```elixir
# Disable identity state (keep thread)
use Jido.Agent,
  name: "minimal",
  default_plugins: %{__identity__: false}

# Replace with custom module
use Jido.Agent,
  name: "custom",
  default_plugins: %{__identity__: MyApp.CustomIdentityPlugin}

# Replace with custom module and config
use Jido.Agent,
  name: "configured",
  default_plugins: %{__identity__: {MyApp.CustomIdentityPlugin, %{profile: %{age: 10}}}}

# Replace memory while preserving the canonical :__memory__ state key
use Jido.Agent,
  name: "persistent_memory",
  default_plugins: %{__memory__: {MyApp.PersistentMemoryPlugin, %{store: MyApp.Store}}}

# Disable memory (keep others)
use Jido.Agent,
  name: "no_memory",
  default_plugins: %{__memory__: false}

# Disable all defaults
use Jido.Agent,
  name: "bare",
  default_plugins: false
```

> **Note:** `default_plugins:` only controls built-in defaults. To add new plugins, use the `plugins:` option.

For pod-wrapped agents, the reserved `:__pod__` plugin can be replaced but
should not be disabled. See [Pods](pods.md) for the pod-specific contract.
